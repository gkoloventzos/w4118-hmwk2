a.) If we run our test program  --without rebooting the emulator-- the
	following apply with respect to each field of prinfo struct.
        -ppid: May change if parent process exits and current process
               becomes an orphan and get adopted by init.
        -pid: Remains unchanged for the life-time of a process
        -youngest_child_pid: May change if current process forks a new child
                             or the youngest child exits.
        -next_sibling: May change if current process is the youngest child
                       of its parent and the parent fork a new child [1]. Also,
                       may change if current sibling exits.
        -state: Changes whenever the state of the current process changes.
                For instance for stopped into runnnable.
        -uid: Cannot change, since we are using real_cread which is not
              overridable [2].
        -comm:

b.) When the web browser is started only one new process is started, which is
	'android.browser'. Its parent process is 'zygote'. When you press the
	"Home" button, no process is destroyed because the "Home" button does not
	kill the current running process, but makes it run in the background.

c.)


[1] Note that fork invokes list_Add_tail and thus the last child
is the youngest.
