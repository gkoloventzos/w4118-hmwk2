a.) If we run our test program  --without rebooting the emulator-- the
	following apply with respect to each field of prinfo struct.
        -ppid: May change if parent process exits and current process
               becomes an orphan and get adopted by init.
        -pid: Remains unchanged for the life-time of a process
        -youngest_child_pid: May change if current process forks a new child
                             or the youngest child exits.
        -next_sibling: May change if current process is the youngest child
                       of its parent and the parent fork a new child [1]. Also,
                       may change if current sibling exits.
        -state: Changes whenever the state of the current process changes.
                For instance for stopped into runnnable.
        -uid: Cannot change, since we are using real_cread which is not
              overridable [2].
        -comm: Can change using the prctl() system call (see exercise c. ii)

b.) When the web browser is started only one new process is started, which is
	'android.browser'. Its parent process is 'zygote'. When you press the
	"Home" button, no process is destroyed because the "Home" button does not
	kill the current running process, but makes it run in the background.

c.) i. Zygote is meant to boot up Android applications [3].
	ii. Zygote is found in the Android source code and not in the kernel, which
		is why we cannot find it in the hw repo. It is started by the
		'app_process' binary and the name 'zygote' is set in the same binary
		(see line 292 "set_process_name(niceName);") [3]. The set_process_name
		high-level function uses the prctl() system call in order to modify
		the name [4].
	iii. Zygote runs a VM and whenever a new application is about to start
		the VM is duplicated using fork() (lines 53-60 [5]). Zygote optimizes
		memory usage by sharing the core libraries accros child processes
		instead of copying them over for each fork()ed child (lines 84-95
		and 338-339 [5]). This is the reason why an embedded system would run
		a process like zygote, the fact that it minimizes memory usage for
		heavily used libraries.

[1] Note that fork invokes list_Add_tail and thus the last child
	is the youngest.
