a.) If we run our test program  --without rebooting the emulator-- the
following apply with respect to each field of prinfo struct.
        -ppid:vMay change if parent process exits and current process
               becomes an orphan and get adopted by init.
        -pid: Remains unchanged for the life-time of a process
        -youngest_child_pid: May change if current process forks a new child
                             or the youngest child exits.
        -next_sibling: May change if current process is the youngest child
                       of its parent and the parent fork a new child [1]. Also,
                       may change if current sibling exits.
        -state: Changes whenever the state of the current process changes.
                For instance for stopped into runnnable.
        -uid: Cannot change, since we are using real_cread which is not
              overridable [2].
        -comm:

c.)



[1] Note that fork invokes list_Add_tail and thus the last child
is the youngest.
